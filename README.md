I have developed 2 games in C: Tic-tac-toe and Unjumble the words.

The Tic-tac-toe game provides a randomized 3 x 3 grid of numbers. Two players take turns to replace a number by x or o. The first player to get 3 in a row, column or diagonal wins. If there is no winner, a draw is declared.

The Unjumble the words game takes the player through 10 levels of increasing difficulty. The player is supposed to unjumble the words given to him. Hints are provided in the tougher levels. The unique feature about this game is that I have written code to jumble the words in a unique order, every time the game is played. At the end of 10 levels, the player's score is displayed.
